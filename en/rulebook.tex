\section{Clarifications}
Requests for rule clarifications may be made on the Student Robotics forums, and this document will be updated if deemed necessary.  Requests received within one month of the competition are unlikely to be processed.

The following changes have been made to the rules since their initial release:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item 2014-11-10: Change rule 1.6 to refer to \emph{match officials} rather than a \emph{judge}.
  \item 2014-11-10: Change the gap between zones (including the barriers) from $300mm$ to $400mm$.
                    This ensures that a flag cannot be in more than one zone, even diagonally.
  \item 2014-11-10: Require that robots do not touch multiple flags at once.
  \item 2014-12-05: Remove invalid references to "slots" left over from SR2014.
  \item 2015-02-20: Clarify the size and position of the flag adornments.
\end{enumerate}
