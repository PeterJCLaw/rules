\begin{enumerate}

%% Behaviour

\item No remote control systems may be used.
\item This is a non-contact sport, but accidental bumps and scrapes are inevitable.
\item Robots must not intentionally damage anything -- including tokens, pedestals, the arena or other robots.
\item Student Robotics reserves the right to examine your robot software and hardware at any time.
\item Assistance from Student Robotics Engineers is provided without any guarantees.
\item All kit deployed by Student Robotics remains the property of Student Robotics.
      All electronic kit \textbf{must} be returned to Student Robotics after the competition.
      \autoref{sec:kit-return} details the parts of the kit that must be returned.
      After the competition, the kit that is not specified in \autoref{sec:kit-return} becomes the property of the team.

\item The Judge's decision is final.

%% Physical

\item Robots must pass an inspection by a Student Robotics Inspector before competing in a match.
      This inspector will check that the robot complies with the rules and regulations of this game.
      \textbf{Robots that have not passed inspection will not be permitted to compete}.

\item At the beginning of each match, robots must fit within a cube with $500mm$ internal sides.
      \textit{During the match}, the robot may extend beyond this size up to a height, width, or length of $650mm$.

\item The power board, including its power switch, must be easily accessible at all times -- including throughout the game.
      This is for everyone's safety, especially your robot's.

\item All custom electronics that require a connection to the battery must instead be connected to the motor rail.
      There are extra connectors on the power board for this purpose.

\item All wires connected to the robot's ground (0V line) must be black.
      Black wires \emph{must not} be used for anything else.
      It is \emph{strongly recommended} that all wiring is neat and easily removable, as this will reduce the time required to debug problems on robots
       (teams may be asked to tidy their wiring before a Student Robotics Engineer will approach any issues with their robot).

\item All electronics must be securely fixed to the robot, and should also be easily removable.

\item It must not be possible to injure oneself on the robot.
      This will be tested using a Frankfurter sausage to simulate a finger.
      For example, high-speed rotating parts that could cause injury must be suitably shielded.

\item Robots must feature four mountings for robot badges.
      These mountings must comply with the specification in section~\ref{sec:robot-badges}.

\item The lithium-ion polymer batteries provided in the kit must be shielded from mechanical and thermal harm.
      This includes mechanical protection from accidental impact with other robots.
      Teams found to be in violation of this rule will have their batteries confiscated until they have demonstrably rectified the identified issues.

\item If teams wish to use batteries other than the lithium-ion polymer batteries provided,
       then they must seek approval from Student Robotics through the Student Robotics forums first.
      Additionally, if teams wish to add systems powered by separate batteries then they must seek approval through the same channel first.

      In general, teams are encouraged to power everything off the SR-supplied battery through the power board.
      All electromechanical components \textbf{must} be powered through the motor rail provided by the power board.

\item Robots may not include radio transmitters or receivers.
      In exceptional circumstances, teams may request an exemption from this rule.
