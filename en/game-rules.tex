\section {Game Rules}
\label{game-rules}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The game, called \textbf{Capture the Flag}, will be played in the arena defined in section~\ref{sub:arena}.
      The objective of this game is to have as many flags as possible in your scoring zone by the end of the match.

\item Before a match begins, participating teams must:
\begin {enumerate}
  \item Present their robot in the staging area, adjacent to the arena, at least 2 minutes before the scheduled start time.
        The staging area will be clearly marked on the day.

  \item Attach four robot badges.
        These badges will be provided by Student Robotics officials in the staging area.
        Section~\ref{sec:robot-badges} provides more information about these badges, as well as their dimensions and mounting requirements.

  \item Place their robot in the starting corner that they are assigned.
        The robot must be placed such that it is entirely within this starting corner, with no parts overhanging its boundary.

  \item Vacate the arena 40 seconds before the scheduled start time.
        During the 40 second period prior to the start of the match there must be no interaction with the robot.
\end{enumerate}
  Teams that fail to comply with this rule may forfeit the match, at the discretion of the judge.

\item A match lasts 180 seconds.

\item There will be a maximum of 4 robots in a match.

\item Robots will be started by teams leaning into the arena to press the start button on their robot\footnote{A wireless match-starting solution may be provided by Student Robotics.} when instructed to do so.

\item A match may be terminated prematurely if all teams participating in that match state to the match officials that they are happy for the game to end.

\item Flags must not leave the arena floor for the duration of the match.

\item Robots must not intentionally touch multiple flags at once.

\item At the end of a match, each team's \textbf{game points} will be calculated.
      These are used to rank teams before competition league points are awarded.
      \textbf{1 point} will be awarded for each flag in a robot's allocated scoring zone when a match ends.
      A flag is considered in a zone if at least one caster is in contact with the zone.

\item At the end of a game, league points will be awarded as follows.
      The team with the \emph{most} game points will be awarded 8 points towards the competition league.
      The team with the second most will be awarded 6.
      The team with the third most will be awarded 4 points, and the team with the fewest game points will be awarded 2 points.
      Teams whose robot was not entered into the round, or who were disqualified from the round, will be awarded no points.

      Tied robots will be awarded the average of the points that their combined positions would be awarded.
      Thus, three robots tied for first place would receive 6 points each (since this is $(8+6+4)/3$).

\item Once the league has completed, a knockout competition will begin.
      The positions of the teams in the league will seed the positions of teams in the knockout matches.
      The top teams from the league advance to the knockout.
      The number of teams progressing to the knockout will be announced before the start of the league matches.
      In the event of tied league positions, the team with the greatest cumulative game points in the league will go through.

      Each match in the knockout competition involves up to 4 teams.
      The teams that come 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} in each knockout match will continue to the next round of the knockout.
      In the event of a tie in a knockout match, the team that ranked highest in the league will go through.
      If there is a tie in the final, then a rematch will be played.
      The number of league and knockout matches will be announced on the morning of the competition.

\end{enumerate}
