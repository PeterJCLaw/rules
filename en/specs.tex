\subsection{Markers}
\label{sub:markers}
The arena, tokens, buckets, and robots involved in the game are labelled with \textit{libkoki} markers.  Each marker pattern encodes a number.  Each marker number is associated with a particular feature within the arena, and also has an associated size.  The marker numbers and sizes are as follows:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{lcc}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Item} & \textbf{Marker Numbers} & \textbf{Marker Size (mm)} \\
    \midrule
    Arena boundary & 0 -- 27 & 250 \\
    Robots & 28 -- 31 & 100 \\
    Tokens & 32 -- 71 & 100 \\
    Bucket side & 72 -- 75 & 100 \\
    Bucket end & 76 -- 79 & 100 \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Two sets of marker codes will be used: one for development purpose, and one for the competition itself.  The competition set is only to be used inside the Student Robotics arena at the Student Robotics competition.  This is so that people carrying markers past the arena do not confuse robots.  The competition codes are 100 above the development codes.  When run in competition mode (specifiable through the robot's GUI), the software provided by Student Robotics will subtract 100 from the detected marker codes, as well as ignore the development codes.

The markers can be printed on a black-and-white printer.  Marker designs can be downloaded from the documentation section of the Student Robotics website.

\subsection{Arena}
\label{sub:arena}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The match arena floor, overall, is an $8m \times 8m$ square, as shown in \autoref{fig:arena-dim}.
 The tolerance of these two dimensions is $\pm0.25m$.

\end{figure}

\item The barrier is a horizontal bar arranged in a $6m \times 6m$ square centred and aligned with the boundary of the arena.  The barrier is suspended by eight $100mm \times 100mm$ wide legs located at the positions shown in figure TODO.  These legs maintain the lower edge of the barrier at $750mm$ above the floor.

\item The floor of the arena is carpeted.  The carpet tiles used in the arena will be from B\&Q, with EAN 5014957151543.

\item The outer arena walls are $600\pm30mm$ high, the interior surfaces of which are white plastic-coated hardboard.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Tokens}
\label{sub:Tokens}
\begin {enumerate}
\item Tokens are cubic cardboard boxes with side approximately $102mm$.
\emph{Each team's kit contains four of these.}
\item Tokens have a mass of $475\pm30g$.
\end {enumerate}

\subsection{Buckets}
