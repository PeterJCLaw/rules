\subsection{Arena}
\label{sub:arena}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The match arena floor, overall, is an $8m \times 8m$ square, as shown in \autoref{fig:arena-dim}.
 The tolerance of these two dimensions is $\pm0.25m$.

  \caption{\label{fig:internal-wall}Dimensions for the internal wall, including the blue squares.}
\end{figure}

\item The width of the track is $2\pm0.1m$.
\item The floor of the arena is made of white plastic coated hardboard.
 White Gaffer tape will be in place over the joints between hardboard sheets.
\item The outer arena walls are $600\pm30mm$ high and are made of the same material as the arena floor.
 The internal walls will be $200\pm10mm$ high, and also white, as shown in \autoref{fig:internal-wall}.
\item Robots may not enter the areas bounded by the internal wall.
\item The blue squares alongside the internal wall have sides of $50\pm5mm$, and are spaced $150\pm10mm$ apart (as per \autoref{fig:internal-wall}).
\item No guarantee is offered of the colour of the area inside the internal wall (the section greyed out in \autoref{fig:arena-dim}).
 We can guarantee, however, that anything visible within the arena above $200mm$ and below $600mm$ will be either white or black (as those colours are not visible to the vision system).
\item The boundaries of the arena's quadrants are shown in \autoref{fig:quadrants}.

           Note that the lines won't actually exist, they are just here to illustrate.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\item A black gaffer tape line is present across the corridor before the entrance to the ramp.  \autoref{fig:ramp-entrance} shows the position and dimensions of this line, and the alignment of the blue squares in the ramp entrance.

  \end{figure}


\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Ramp}
\label{sub:Ramp}
\begin {enumerate}
\item The ramp has the dimensions and shape shown in \autoref{fig:ramp-on-its-own}.
\item The ramp has a footprint of $2.75m \times 1m$.
\item All track-facing vertical surfaces of the ramp are painted white.
\end {enumerate}

  \caption{\label{fig:ramp-on-its-own}The ramp that cuts one of the corners of the arena, as seen in \autoref{fig:arena-dim}.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tokens}
\label{sub:Tokens}
\begin {enumerate}
\item Tokens are baked bean cans approximately $110mm$ high, with an approximate diameter of $75mm$.
\emph{Each team's kit contains one of these.}
\item Tokens have a mass of $475\pm30g$.  \emph{We're using tins of ASDA ``Smartprice'' Baked beans.  Remember that the mass on the label is the mass of the contents of the tin.}
\item Tokens will be painted red with a paint colour close to RAL 3020.  \emph{``RAL'' is  a colour matching system.  Most serious paint vendors will take RAL numbers, such as Johnstones.  B\&Q do not.}

\item The super token is designed to be visually indistinguishable by the robots from the other tokens.  It will have a small marking on it to allow a person to identify it upon close inspection.
\item All tokens will be standing up at the start of the match.
\end {enumerate}
