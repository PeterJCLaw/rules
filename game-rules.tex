\section {Game Rules}
\label{game-rules}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The game that will be played is called \textbf{Supermarket Sweep}.
\item The arena (see \nameref{sec:Specifications}) will contain 9 tokens (8 around the track, and 1 on the ramp).
 They will be arranged randomly, with 2 on each side as shown in \autoref{fig:arena-dim}.
 The token on the ramp --- also know as the ``\textbf{super token}'' --- will be distinguishable by a human only (by a marking on top).
\item Teams will be assigned a corner of the arena that their robot will start the game in.
 The robot must be placed within $100mm$ of both of the arena walls.
\item At the end of a match, after all tokens have settled, a team's ``\textbf{game points}'' will be calculated.
 These are used to rank teams before competition league points are awarded.
\item A token will be considered to have been collected by a robot if, at the end of the game, that token is supported by a robot.
 Tokens touching the floor or walls of the arena or ramp will not be counted.

\item The arena is considered to be split into quadrants, with the boundary lines going from corner to corner (see \autoref{fig:quadrants}).

\item Robots must travel in an anti-clockwise direction to gain any points.

\item Game points are awarded as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item When a robot moves from its starting position, \textbf{1 point} is awarded.
\item When a robot enters a new quadrant\footnote{The back of the robot must be beyond the imaginary quadrant line.}, \textbf{2 points} are awarded.
\item When a robot carries any token (that includes the super token) over a quadrant boundary, \textbf{1 point} is awarded.
\item When the back of a robot passes the top of the upward-sloping section of the ramp, \textbf{3 points} are awarded.
\item When the back of a robot passes the bottom of the downward-sloping section of the ramp, \textbf{3 points} are awarded.
\item When a robot ends the game holding\footnote{To find out if a robot is holding a token, it will be lifted clear of any arena surfaces that may be supporting a token.} a normal token, \textbf{2 points} are awarded.
\item When a robot ends the game holding the super token, their \textbf{total score} for that game will be \textbf{doubled}.
\end{itemize}

\item At the end of a game, the team with the \emph{most} game points is awarded 4 points towards the competition league.
 The team with the second most is awarded 3.
 The team with the third most is awarded 2 points, and the team with the fewest game points is awarded 1 point.
 Teams whose robot was not entered into the round, or who were disqualified from the round, will be awarded no points.

\item There will be a maximum of 4 robots in a match.
\item A match lasts 180 seconds.
\item Matches are started and stopped by the Student Robotics Infrared system\footnote{The Student Robotics Infrared system is supplied as part of the kit.
 It is used for safety cut-off, start-match and stop-match signals.}.
\item Teams that do not present their robot promptly for a match will forfeit that match.
\end{enumerate}
