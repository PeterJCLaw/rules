\section {Game Rules}
\label{game-rules}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The game, called \textbf{Easy as ABC}, will be played in the arena defined in section~\ref{sub:arena}.  The objective of this game is to collect A, B and C tokens in a combination that scores the most points, whilst preventing your opponents from scoring as high as you!

\item Before a match begins, participating teams must:
\begin {enumerate}
  \item Present their robot in the staging area, adjacent to the arena, at least 2 minutes before the scheduled start time.
        The staging area will be clearly marked on the day.

  \item Place their robot in the starting zone that they are assigned.
        The robot must be placed such that it is entirely within this starting zone, with no parts overhanging its boundary.

  \item Vacate the arena 40 seconds before the scheduled start time.
        During the 40 second period prior to the start of the match there must be no interaction with the robot.
\end{enumerate}
  Teams that fail to comply with this rule may forfeit the match, at the discretion of the judge.

\item A match lasts 180 seconds.

\item There will be a maximum of 4 robots in a match.

\item Robots will be started by teams leaning into the arena to press the start button on their robot\footnote{A wireless match-starting solution may be provided by Student Robotics.} when instructed to do so.

\item A match may be terminated prematurely if all teams participating in that match state to the match officials that they are happy for the game to end.

\item At the end of a match, each team's \textbf{game points} will be calculated.  These are used to rank teams before competition league points are awarded.  Game points will be awarded to each team as follows:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{1 point} will be awarded for each token which is within that team's allocated zone.
  \item A further \textbf{1 point} will be awarded for every B-token present within that team's allocated zone, provided there is at least one A-token within that zone.
  \item A further \textbf{2 points} will be awarded for every C-token present within that team's allocated zone, provided there is at least one A-token and at least one B-token within that zone.
  \end{enumerate}
  A token is considered to be in a zone if any part of that token is touching the arena floor within the scoring zone.

  For example, if a zone contains two A-tokens, and one B-token then the associated team will score 4 points.  If a zone contains one A-token and one C-token, then the team would score 2 points.

\item At the end of a game, league points will be awarded as follows.
      The team with the \emph{most} game points will be awarded 8 points towards the competition league.
      The team with the second most will be awarded 6.
      The team with the third most will be awarded 4 points, and the team with the fewest game points will be awarded 2 points.
      Teams whose robot was not entered into the round, or who were disqualified from the round, will be awarded no points.

      Tied robots will be awarded the average of the points that their combined positions would be awarded.
      Thus, three robots tied for first place would receive 6 points each (since this is $(8+6+4)/3$).

\item Once the league has completed, a knockout competition will begin.
      The positions of the teams in the league will seed the positions of teams in the knockout matches.
      The top teams from the league advance to the knockout.
      The number of teams progressing to the knockout will be announced before the start of the league matches.
      In the event of tied league positions, the team with the greatest cumulative game points in the league will go through.

      Each match in the knockout competition involves up to 4 teams.
      The teams that come 1\textsuperscript{st} and 2\textsuperscript{nd} in each knockout match will continue to the next round of the knockout.
      In the event of a tie in a knockout match, the team that ranked highest in the league will go through.
      If there is a tie in the final, then a rematch will be played.
      The number of league and knockout matches will be announced on the morning of the competition.

\end{enumerate}
