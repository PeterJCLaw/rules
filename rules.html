        <ol>
          <li>
            The game, called <strong>LORAN Order</strong>, is a game of territorial
            control, in which robots compete to gain the most territory.
          <li>
            The game is played between <strong>two</strong> robots.
          <li>
            Each match lasts for <strong>120</strong> seconds.
          <li>
            Territories start the game <strong>unowned</strong>. They may be
            <strong>captured</strong> and thereby belong to one robot.
          <li>
            Robots are awarded points at the end of the match for the maximum
            extent of their territory at any one time. Each owned territory at
            the maximum extent is worth <strong>2</strong> points.
          <li>
            The arena is a rectangle of the design specified in
            <a href="#specifications">the specifications section</a>.
          <li>
            In the centre of each territory is a <strong>tower</strong>.
          <li>
            To capture a territory, a robot approaches the tower, and from within
            the territory transmits a radio signal to it.
          <li>
            Each tower has a <strong>station code</strong>, which it continuously
            broadcasts; the robot can use the <strong>radar</strong> functionality
            of its radio to identify the signal strength and relative bearing to
            any tower.
          <li>
            This is the <strong>first</strong> module of the game.

        <ol>
          <li>
            All robots must be safe.
          <li>
            The Judge’s decision is final.
          <li>
            Any assistance from Student Robotics volunteers is provided without guarantees.
          <li>
            Student Robotics reserves the right to examine teams’ robot software at any time.
          <li>
            Teams are expected to conduct themselves within the normal principles of good
            sporting conduct.

          <li>
            The above figure represents, to scale, the design of the arena. The arena is
            <strong>10m</strong> along its long axis, and <strong>5m</strong> along its
            short axis.
          <li>
            The green boxes denote the <strong>robot start locations</strong>. The robot
            denoted as being starting zone 0 is in the top left, the robot denoted as being
            starting zone 1 is in the top right.
          <li>
            Grey regions indicate <strong>internal walls</strong> of the arena, which are
            impassable to robots.
          <li>
            The salmon-shaded regions indicate the <strong>territories</strong>.
          <li>
            The orange circles in the centre of the territories denote the
            <strong>towers</strong>. Underneath each tower in the figure is its
            <strong>station code</strong>.
          <li>
            The canonical specification of all features of the arena is the simulator
            itself.

        <h2><a class="anchor" id="comp-structure"></a>Competition Structure</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The competition is structured in two phases: the <strong>leagues</strong>
            and the <strong>knockout</strong>.
          <li>
            The leagues take place across four different dates.
          <li>
            At the end of each game played within a league,
            <strong>league points</strong> are awarded. The team whose robot
            won the match are awarded <strong>4</strong> league points, and the
            team which lost the match are awarded <strong>2</strong> league points.
            In the event of a tie, both teams are awarded <strong>3</strong> league points.
            If for any reason a team is disqualified from a match, they will not
            receive the league points.
          <li>
            At the end of the leagues, positions in the leagues are used to seed a
            knockout. This will be used to determine the final 1<sup>st</sup>,
            2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> awards.
          <li>
            The exact structure of the knockout will be announced at a later date.
