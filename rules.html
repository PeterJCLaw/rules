        <ol>
          <li>
            The game, called <strong>Radars of the Lost Ark</strong>, is a game of
            territorial control, in which robots compete to gain the most territory.
          <li>
            The game is played between <strong>two</strong> robots.
          <li>
            Each match lasts for <strong>120</strong> seconds.
          <li>
            Territories start the game <strong>unclaimed</strong> and <strong>unlocked</strong>. They may be
            <strong>claimed</strong> and thereby belong to one robot.
          <li>
            The territories and starting zones form a network as shown in <a href="#specifications">the
            specifications section</a>. Territories which are adjacent
            (within the network) to another territory or a zone are said to be <strong>linked</strong>
            to that territory or zone.
          <li>
            A territory can only be claimed by a robot if it is 
            unlocked and linked to their starting zone or 
            a territory already owned by that robot. 
          <li>
            The number of times a territory has been claimed increases even if the claiming robot already
            owns the territory. 
          <li>
            Two territories are <strong>connected</strong> if they are linked and 
            both owned by the same robot.
          <li>
            If a territory owned by a robot is no longer connected, either directly or
            through other territories, to that robot’s zone, it becomes unclaimed. This does 
            not increase the number of times the territory has been claimed.
          <li>
            After a territory has been claimed <strong>4</strong> times, it becomes <strong>locked</strong>
            and unowned.
          <li>
            Robots are awarded points at the end of the match for the number of 
            territories currently held. Each owned territory is worth 
            <strong>2</strong> points.
          <li>
            At the end of the match the robot with the most points wins. In the event both robots have the
            same number of points, the match is a tie.
          <li>
            The arena is a rectangle of the design specified in
            <a href="#specifications">the specifications section</a>.
          <li>
            Two of the internal walls in the arena are moveable. At the start of the
            match these walls are raised. At <strong>60</strong> seconds into the
            match these start to descend, it takes <strong>1</strong> second for the
            walls to fully descend. Once fully descended robots are able to
            drive over them.
          <li>
            In the centre of each territory is a <strong>tower</strong>.
          <li>
            To capture a territory, a robot approaches the tower, and from within
            the territory transmits a radio signal to it.
          <li>
            Each tower has a <strong>station code</strong>, which it continuously
            broadcasts; the robot can use the <strong>radar</strong> functionality
            of its radio to identify the signal strength and relative bearing to
            any tower.
          <li>
            This is the <strong>third</strong> module of the game.

          <li>
            All robots must be safe.

            Any assistance from Student Robotics volunteers is provided without guarantees.
          <li>
            Student Robotics reserves the right to examine teams’ robot software at any time.
          <li>
            Teams are expected to conduct themselves within the normal principles of good
            sporting conduct.
          <li>
            While accidental bumps and scrapes are inevitable, the sport is non-contact.

            The above figure represents, to scale, the design of the arena. The arena is
            <strong>10m</strong> along its long axis, and <strong>5m</strong> along its

            Light grey regions indicate <strong>moveable internal walls</strong> of the arena, which are
            impassable to robots only while raised.

            The salmon-shaded regions indicate the <strong>territories</strong>.

        <ol>
          <li>
            The competition is structured in two phases: the <strong>leagues</strong>
            and the <strong>knockout</strong>.
          <li>
            The leagues take place across four different dates.
          <li>
            At the end of each game played within a league,
            <strong>league points</strong> are awarded. The team whose robot
            won the match are awarded <strong>4</strong> league points, and the
            team which lost the match are awarded <strong>2</strong> league points.
            In the event of a tie, both teams are awarded <strong>3</strong> league points.
            If for any reason a team is disqualified from a match, they will not
            receive the league points.
          <li>
            At the end of the leagues, positions in the leagues are used to seed a
            knockout. This will be used to determine the final 1<sup>st</sup>,
            2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> awards.
          <li>
            The exact structure of the knockout will be announced at a later date.
