        <ol>
          <li>
            The objective of the game, called <strong>Greed</strong>, is to capture tokens from your opponents.
          <li>
            Before a match begins, participating teams must:
            <ul>
              <li>Present their robot in the staging area, adjacent to the arena, before the scheduled close of staging time. The staging area will be clearly marked on the day.
              <li>Attach a <a href="#flag-specification">robot flag</a>. Robot flags will be provided by Student Robotics officials in the staging area.
              <li>Place their robot in the starting area that they are assigned. The robot must be placed such that it is entirely within this starting area, with no parts overhanging its boundary. Its orientation does not matter.
              <li>Vacate the arena 40 seconds before the scheduled start time. During the 40 second period prior to the start of the match there must be no interaction with the robot.
              <li>Follow the directions of the match officials.
            </ul>
            Teams that fail to comply with these rules – such as by arriving late – may forfeit the match, at the discretion of the judge.
          <li>
            The game is played between <strong>four</strong> robots.
          <li>
            Each match lasts for <strong>150</strong> seconds.
          <li>
            Robots will be started by, or at the direction of, match officials.
          <li>
            There are 20 Bronze tokens, 12 Silver tokens and 4 Gold tokens in the arena at the start of the match.
          <li>
            At the end of the match, tokens are nominally worth:
            <ul>
              <li>Bronze tokens: 3 points,
              <li>Silver tokens: 12 points,
              <li>Gold tokens: 30 points.
            </ul>
          <li>
            A token is "in" a scoring zone if any of the vertical projection of the token onto the arena floor is within the zone.
            Tokens "in" a scoring zone award their values to the team which owns the scoring zone.
          <li>
            A token is "in" a robot if the token is lifted when the robot is lifted. Tokens "in" a robot have one third of their value
            awarded to that robot. Tokens in robots are not in any scoring zone.
          <li>
            There is a bonus point available for a robot fully leaving its scoring zone for the first time in a game.
          <li>
            Robots start inside the starting area within their scoring zone.
          <li>
            At the end of the match the robot with the most points wins.
          <li>
            The arena is a square of the design specified in
            <a href="#specifications">the specifications section</a>.
          <li>
            A match may be terminated prematurely if all teams participating in that match state to the match officials that they are happy for the game to end.

          Two sets of marker codes will be used: one for development purposes, and one for the competition itself. The competition set is only to be used inside the Student Robotics arena at the Student Robotics competition. This is so that people carrying markers past the arena do not confuse robots. The competition codes are 100 above the development codes. When run in competition mode, the software provided by Student Robotics will subtract 100 from the detected marker codes, as well as ignore the development codes. Markers outside of the ranges used in the game will also be ignored.

            <strong>5.75m</strong> square.
          <li>
            The floor of the arena is covered with a closed-loop, short pile carpet.
          <li>
            The perimeter of the arena floor is delimited by the arena wall, which has a minimum height of 100mm.
          <li>
            Each wall of the arena features seven 200mm AprilTag markers.
          <li>
            Each robot will be assigned a corner at the start of every match to indicate its scoring zone.
          <li>
            Starting areas are 1000 ±50mm squares within their respective scoring zones and will be marked by tape.
          <li>
            The green boxes denote the robot start locations. Robots may start facing any direction.
          <li>
            In the centre of the arena is a square plinth with cruciform arms extending from the centre of each side.

        <p>
          The competition is structured in four phases:
            the <strong>challenges</strong>,
            the <strong>virtual league</strong>,
            the <strong>main league</strong>
            and the <strong>knockout</strong>.
        </p>
        <h3><a class="anchor" id="challenges-summary"></a>Challenges</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            There are three challenges which teams may optionally complete during the competition year in order to earn additional league points.
            The challenges may be approached in any order.
          <li>
            Teams which complete one of the challenges by 8pm GMT on January 7<sup>th</sup> 2023 will earn 8 league points.
          <li>
            Teams which complete a different challenge by 8pm GMT on February 4<sup>th</sup> 2023 will earn a separate 8 league points.
          <li>
            Submissions for each challenge should be made as a video on the web
            (e.g: on YouTube, Instagram, etc.) and linking this video in the
            Student Robotics Discord, tagged with <code>@Challenges</code>.
          <li>
            The challenges are specified in the <a href="#challenges">challenges section</a>.

        <h3><a class="anchor" id="virtual-league"></a>Virtual League</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            There will be a livestreamed virtual league one month before the in-person competition.
          <li>
            The virtual league will use the <a href="https://studentrobotics.org/docs/simulator/">Webots based simulator</a>.
          <li>
            During the virtual league, each robot will have four match appearances.
          <li>
            The livestream will be on a Saturday afternoon.
            The date will be confirmed when the date of the competition is confirmed.
          <li>
            Code submissions will close at 8pm GMT on the Friday before the virtual league.
          <li>
            The matches played during the virtual league constitute the first matches of the league. As such, you will be awarded league points as outlined below.
        </ol>
        <h3><a class="anchor" id="matches"></a>Matches</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The main league and the knockout will be played at the in-person competition event.
          <li>
            At the end of a game, league points will be awarded as follows. The team with the most
            game points will be awarded 8 points towards the competition league. The team with the
            second most will be awarded 6. The team with the third most will be awarded 4 points,
            and the team with the fewest game points will be awarded 2 points. Teams whose robot
            was not entered into the round, or who were disqualified from the round, will be awarded
            no points.
          <li>
            Tied robots will be awarded the average of the points that their combined positions would
            be awarded. Thus, three robots tied for first place would receive 6 points each (since this
            is (8 + 6 + 4) ÷ 3).
          <li>
            At the end of the leagues, positions in the leagues are used to seed a
            knockout. This will be used to determine the final 1<sup>st</sup>,
            2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> awards.
          <li>
            In the event of a tie in a knockout match, the team that ranked highest in the league will
            go through.

            <ul>
              <li>LED A in blue when more than 30° left from square on,
              <li>LED B in blue in the middle (60° arc) and
              <li>LED C in blue when more than 30° right from square on.
            </ul>
          <li>
            Facing the wall at a point 1m out from the wall and directly in
            front of the middle of the three markers, move left and right
            illuminating LEDs to indicate the position of the robot relative
            to a line through the middle marker and orthogonal to the wall:
            <ul>
              <li>LED A in red when more than 200mm left of the line
              <li>LED B in blue within 200mm of the line
              <li>LED C in red when more than 200mm right of the line
            </ul>
          <li>
            The robot may move autonomously or may be moved manually to complete this challenge.
            <br>
            <strong>Note:</strong> if moving the robot manually then the
            Ruggeduino, Motor and Servo Boards must be disconnected from the
            Power Board as well as any mechanical components secured for the
            duration of the demonstration.
