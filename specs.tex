\subsection{Markers}
\label{sub:markers}
The arena, tokens and robots involved in the game are labelled with \textit{libkoki} markers.
Each marker pattern encodes a number.
Each marker number is associated with a particular feature within the arena, and also has an associated size.
The marker numbers and sizes are as follows:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{lcc}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Item} & \textbf{Marker Numbers} & \textbf{Marker Size (mm)} \\
    \midrule
    Arena boundary & {} 0 -- 27 & 250 \\
    Robots & 28 -- 31 & 100 \\
    Tokens & 32 -- 35 & 100 \\
    Wall of the volcano & 36 -- 55 & 100 \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Two sets of marker codes will be used: one for development purposes, and one for the competition itself.
The competition set is only to be used inside the Student Robotics arena at the Student Robotics competition.
This is so that people carrying markers past the arena do not confuse robots.
The competition codes are 100 above the development codes.
When run in competition mode, the software provided by Student Robotics will subtract 100 from the detected marker codes, as well as ignore the development codes.

The markers can be printed on a black-and-white printer.
Marker designs can be downloaded from the documentation section of the Student Robotics website.

Unless specified otherwise, all markers described in this document are oriented vertically such that the principle corner of the marker (which is indicated by a dark grey dot in the black marker border) is on the higher edge.

\subsection{Robot Badges}
\label{sub:robot-badges}

\begin{figure}

  \caption{An example robot badge.
           The blue areas shown are the human-compatible areas.
           All dimensions are in millimetres.}
  \label{fig:example-badge}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\item A ``robot badge'' is a removable identifier that will be attached to a robot throughout a match.
      It features the robot's assigned marker for the match, as well as human-compatible areas to allow spectators to easily associate a robot with its starting location.
      An example of one of these badges is shown in figure~\ref{fig:example-badge}.
      The markings in the human-compatible areas are intentionally not specified.

\item A robot must feature four of the badge mounts shown in figure~\ref{fig:badge-mounting}.
      These mounts must permit a flat $200 \times 100mm$ panel to be attached to them.
      The three areas of each mount must feature the illustrated areas of hook-type Velcro to allow this panel to be fitted.

\item The four badge mounts must be on the exterior of the robot, parallel with the vertical plane, and should be perpendicular to each other about the vertical axis\footnote{Teams can apply for a team-specific rule alteration to the required number of badges.
      Clear justification must be provided by the team with such a request.}
      The orientation of the badge mounts is unimportant, but teams are encouraged to position them horizontally as shown in figure~\ref{fig:example-badge}.

\item The mapping between a given robot and its robot badge is as follows:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{cc}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Corner} & \textbf{Marker Number} \\
    \midrule
    0 & 28 \\
    1 & 29 \\
    2 & 30 \\
    3 & 31 \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./images/badge-mounting.pdf}
  \caption{The dimensions of the required robot badge mountings.
           The shaded areas are hook-type Velcro.
           All dimensions are in millimetres.}
  \label{fig:badge-mounting}
\end{figure}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Arena}
\label{sub:arena}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The match arena floor, overall, is an $8m \times 8m$ square, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:arena-dim}.
      The tolerance of these two dimensions is $\pm0.2m$.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./images/arena.pdf}
  \caption{\label{fig:arena-dim}A bird's-eye view of the arena. All dimensions are in millimetres.}
\end{figure}

\item The floor of the arena is covered with a closed-loop, short pile carpet.

\item The perimeter of the arena floor is delimited by the arena wall, which has a minimum height of $100mm$.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./images/sidewall.pdf}
  \caption{Seven $250mm$ wide markers are spaced evenly along each $8m$ arena wall.
           The markers are placed $50mm$ above the floor.
           All dimensions are in millimetres.}
  \label{fig:arena-wall}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./images/arena-markers.pdf}
  \caption{Twenty eight arena wall markers are positioned around the perimeter of the arena with the marker codes incrementing in a clockwise fashion.
           The corners are counted in a clockwise fashion, with corner 0 being the corner closest to arena marker 0.}
  \label{fig:arena-zones}
\end{figure}

\item Each wall of the arena features seven $250mm$ libkoki markers.
      Figure~\ref{fig:arena-wall} shows the positioning of these markers, whilst figure~\ref{fig:arena-zones} shows the numbering of these markers.

\item Each robot will be assigned a corner at the start of every match to indicate its starting position.
      Corner starting positions are $1000 \pm 20mm$ square and will be marked by $25mm$ paper-based masking tape.
      The mapping of these corner numbers in the arena is shown in figure~\ref{fig:arena-zones}.

\item Student Robotics reserves the right to have match officials in the arena during games.

\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Scoring Zones}
\label{sub:Zones}

\begin{enumerate}
\item There are 25 zones in the arena, in a 5 by 5 grid square grid centred within the arena and aligned with its axes. Each zone is $1.1m \pm 40mm$ by $1.1m \pm 40mm$.
      The arrangement and dimensions of these zones can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:arena-dim}.

\item Where the boundary of a scoring zone is not formed by the edge of the volcano it will be marked by $48mm$ coloured tape.
      The tape will be placed along the outside of the edge of the zone, excluding it from the zone for scoring purposes.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Tokens}
\label{sub:Tokens}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Tokens are cubic cardboard boxes with a side length of $100 \pm 10 mm$.

\item There will be 40 tokens in the arena: 10 associated with each starting zone.  These will be arranged as shown in figure~\ref{fig:arena-dim} at the start of a match.

\end{enumerate}
