\subsection{Arena}
\label{sub:arena}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The match arena floor, overall, is an $8m \times 8m$ square, as shown in \autoref{fig:arena-dim}.
 The tolerance of these two dimensions is $\pm0.25m$.

  \caption{\label{fig:arena-dim}An overview of the arena, including baked bean tin tokens.}
\end{figure}


\item The width of the track is $2\pm0.1m$.
\item The floor of the arena is made of white plastic coated hardboard.
 White Gaffer tape will be in place over the joints between hardboard sheets.
\item The outer arena walls are $600\pm30mm$ high and are made of the same material as the arena floor.
 The internal walls will be $200\pm10mm$ high, and also white.
\item Robots may not enter the areas bounded by the internal wall.
\item No guarantee is offered of the colour of the area inside the internal wall (the section greyed out in \autoref{fig:arena-dim}).
 We can guarantee, however, that anything visible within the arena above $200mm$ and below $600mm$ will be either white or black (as those colours are not visible to the vision system).
\item The boundaries of the arena's quadrants are shown in \autoref{fig:quadrants}.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Ramp}
\label{sub:Ramp}
\begin {enumerate}
\item The ramp has the dimensions and shape shown in \autoref{fig:ramp-on-its-own}.
\item The ramp has a footprint of $2.75m \times 1m$.
\item All track-facing vertical surfaces of the ramp are painted white.
\end {enumerate}

  \caption{\label{fig:ramp-on-its-own}The ramp that cuts one of the corners of the arena, as seen in \autoref{fig:arena-dim}.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tokens}
\label{sub:Tokens}
\begin {enumerate}
\item Tokens are baked bean cans approximately $110mm$ high, with an approximate diameter of $75mm$.
\emph{Each team's kit contains one of these.}
\item Tokens have a mass of $475\pm30g$.  \emph{We're using tins of ASDA ``Smartprice'' Baked beans.  Remember that the mass on the label is the mass of the contents of the tin.}
\item Tokens will be painted red with a paint colour close to RAL 3020.  \emph{``RAL'' is  a colour matching system.  Most serious paint vendors will take RAL numbers, such as Johnstones.  B\&Q do not.}

\item The super token is designed to be visually indistinguishable by the robots from the other tokens.  It will have a small marking on it to allow a person to identify it upon close inspection.
\end {enumerate}

\subsection{Robot Flags}
\label{sub:Flags}

Robots \textbf{must} have a flag pole attached.  This will be used during the matches for suspending the infrared system that will be provided to robots before they enter the game.  It may also be used to suspend a team flag.  A diagram of the flagpole arrangement can be found in \autoref{fig:flag}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The top of the flag pole must be $1.1m$ above the floor.  A flag, of maximum size $200mm \times 200mm$, may be mounted $100mm$ from the top of the flag pole.  The flag \textbf{must not} sag below $800mm$ above the floor to avoid interference with the vision system.

\item The pole must be constructed from 25x50mm pine, and must have a $6mm$ diameter hole in it at the position indicated in figure~\ref{fig:ir-mount}.  This hole is for mounting the infrared system during games.

\item The flag pole must be painted green, white or black to avoid interference with other robot's vision system.

\item The flagpole must be removable so that the robot can be placed within a box to check the size limit.
\end{enumerate}
