\subsection{Arena}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The match arena floor, overall, is an $8m \times 8m$ square.
 The tolerance of the two dimensions is $\pm0.25m$.
\item The width of the track is $1.5\pm0.1m$
\item The floor of the arena is made of white plastic coated hardboard.
 White Gaffer tape will be in place over the joints between hardboard sheets.
\item The outer arena walls are $600\pm30mm$ high and are made of the same material as the arena floor.
 The internal walls will be $200\pm30mm$ high, and also white.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Ramp}
\label{ramp}
\begin {enumerate} 
\item The ramp has the dimensions and shape shown in figure~\ref{fig:ramp-on-its-own}.  This figure also shows the black, 60mm gaffer tape strip surrounding the arena.
\item The ramp has a footprint of $2.75m \times 1m$.
\item All track-facing vertical surfaces of the ramp are painted white.
\end {enumerate}

\subsection{Tokens}
\label{tokens}
\begin {enumerate} 
\item Tokens are baked-bean cans of height $XXmm$ and diamater $XXmm$.
 Each team's kit contains a small number of these.
\item Tokens weigh $XX\pm{}XXg$.
\item A token will be red.
\end {enumerate}

\subsection{Robot Flags}
\label{sec:flags}
Robots may have a flagpole that supports the optional team flag, which
is to be designed and created by the team. The team flag allows the
robot to be easily identified.  This flag must be mounted between
$800mm$ and $1m$ off the ground.  It must not extend more than $200mm$
from the flagpole, and must not sag below $800mm$ above the ground.

The flagpole must be removable so that the robot can be placed within a box to check the size limit.
A diagram of the flagpole arrangement can be found in figure~\ref{fig:flag}.
